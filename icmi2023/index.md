## Overview

From tablets to augmented reality, from virtual avatars, to social robots, multimodal, interactive interfaces emerged as interesting tools to facilitate learning in educational scenarios by improving the engagement and the motivation of students towards the learning activities. Research has also shown the potential of such technologies as convenient instruments for the personalization of teaching strategies to the learning styles of each student, proposing appropriate feedback and adapted levels of difficulty in a wider set of learning activities. Such kind of tailoring might become a new, particularly helpful resource to meet the demands of students with special needs. 

The development and the adoption of such interfaces in educational scenarios relies on new pedagogies and new didactics co-designed in an interdisciplinary effort involving engineers, psychologists, cognitive scientists, educators, students, and families.

The aim of this workshop is to provide a venue for all the involved stakeholders to present scientific advances on the design, the development, and the adoption of multimodal, interactive interfaces for education, fostering discussions, ideas and interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers on the domain as well as industrial partners.

## Program
The workshop will be held in **October 13th, 2023**.
Keynotes and contributor’s presentations will be video recorded and made available via a dedicated [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@irecheck). <br/> Proceedings are available at [https://doi.org/10.1145/3610661](https://doi.org/10.1145/3610661).

|	9:05 | **How could poor interactions produce learning effects?**	<br/>	_Pierre Dillenbourg – Computer-Human Interaction for Learning and Instructions Lab, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland_	<br/>	**Invited talk** – Planes don’t flip their wings, but humanoids in education tend to (badly) imitate human roles, teachers, tutees or co-learners. The interactions that a learner may have with a robot are very poor as compared to the interactions with a human. If the richness of interactions does not justify the use of robots, can we creatively use HRI bottleneck as opportunities to invent novel learning situations. To explore this question, we need to start from the mechanisms by which somesocial interactions may, in some conditions, produce learning. <br/>[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ1rwLZylj8)	|

|	11:00 | **Developing and implementing a digital scale for the assessment of literacy Skills (EECL) within the Francophone School Board (CSF) in British Columbia : issues, methods and uses**	<br/>	_Denis Alamargot – Institut National Supérieur du Professorat et de l’Éducation de l’Académie de Poitiers, Université de Poitiers, France_	<br/>	**Invited talk** – Interactive interfaces emerged as interesting tools to facilitate learning in educational scenarios. Thus, it is now possible to take advantage of digital tools to offer new environments for assessing students' reading and writing skills, in order to provide teachers and practitioners with new kinds of student learning profiles, based on scientific evidences. It is to respond to this request, as made by the Francophone School Board (CSF) of British Columbia in Canada, that we develop, in close collaboration with teaching teams and computer developer teams, a « literacy skills assessment scale » (EECL) based on a series of interactive tests, developed on iPad and streaming students’ performance in a centralized database. To date, as deployed, the EECL makes it possible to test nearly 3,000 students each year from kindergarten to the 3rd year of primary school and offers longitudinal monitoring of students, conducive to the adjustment of pedagogical and remediation practices. The objective of this conference is to explain, in addition to the interest of the digital interface for the implementation of the EECL, the method used to mobilize teaching teams and develop the use of this digital tool at the level of a school board of nearly 6,500 students in 47 schools throughout British Columbia.	|

|	13:30 | **Shared Gaze Visualizations in Education**	<br/>	_Bertrand Schneider – Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University, Cambridge, US_	<br/>	**Invited talk** - In this talk, I will discuss the use of synchronized eye-trackers for understanding and supporting remote interactions between students and teachers. This kind of intervention, called Shared Gaze Visualizations (SGVs; D'Angelo & Schneider, 2021), has been found to significantly augment communication, coordination, and overarching collaboration within a dyadic group - which improves learning and teaching. Additionally, I will describe how SGVs are theoretically grounded and offer opportunities to better understand the underlying dynamics of social learning by modeling collaboration from the dual eye-tracking data (e.g., Schneider & Bryant, 2022). I will conclude with thoughts on future work (for example, on the need for better and more intuitive tools for designing SGVs) and how SGVs can be extended to a variety of new technological platforms (e.g., AR/VR headsets). In summary, this talk will make the case that seamless integration of SGVs with advanced technologies can significantly enhance remote learning, which would be crucially needed in case of another pandemic. <br/> [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xeAZhZ1HwM)	|

# Research Engineer in Social Robotics for Children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders
The Pitié-Salpêtrière medical hospital together with CHArt Laboratory from University Paris 8 are seeking for a highly motivated research engineer to contribute to the joint French-Swiss project iReCHeCk.

### Context
iReCHeck is a French-Swiss project founded by ANR and FNS that involves the CHArt Laboratory, from Paris 8 University, the Children and Adolescents Psychiatry Service, from Pitié-Salpêtrière Medical Hospital and the CHILI Laboratory, from EPFL. Built upon the achievements of the Co-Writer Project, iReCheck aims at supporting children with severe handwriting difficulties (dysgraphia) by developing engaging training activities with a robotic co-learner.

The research engineer will be member of the Children and Adolescent Psychiatry Service at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Medical Hospital, an highly multidisciplinary environment located in the center of Paris.

### Tasks
The research engineer will work on the development and the deployment of engaging training activities based on the use of a social robot in learning-by-teaching scenarios. The development of such proactive and believable robotic partner will be achieved in the context of a close collaboration with CHILI Lab.

The research engineer will foster advances on social robots’ interactive abilities, focusing on the profiling of the specific needs of teachers and students and on the adaptation of the robots behaviors and of the proposed training activities to such needs.

The candidate will be called for working in a tight collaboration with the psychiatrists, the psychologists, the psychomotor therapists and the other practitioners from Pitié-Salpêtrière Medical Hospital, having the opportunity of deploying the developed system in real scenarios involving children with neurodevelopmental deficits.

### Profile
As a research engineer for the iReCheck project, the selected candidate will have the opportunity to work with a talented and collaborative team of researchers and access state-of-the-art facilities. The research engineer will be encouraged to publish the results of their works in top-tier journals and to attend conferences to present their findings.

The ideal candidate will have a strong background in computer sciences, robotics, planning and machine learning, with relevant experiences in Python and ROS (Robotics Operating System). A Ph.D. in robotics or intelligent autonomous systems is preferred, but we will also consider candidates with a Master's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics or a related field and exceptional experience. Past experiences in Statistics, Cognitive Sciences,  Signal Processing and, more in general, on computational analysis of human behaviors or on incremental learning, are a plus.

The ideal candidate will have a major interest in the area of robot-assisted therapy/education for children with special needs.
Fluent written and verbal communication skills in English are required.

### Contract details
* Fixed-term,  research engineer contract, 1 year;
* Starting day: as soon as possible;
* Monthly Gross salary: 2400 euro.

### Application procedure
Applications will be considered on a rolling basis until the position is filled, so please apply as soon as possible. Please submit the following documents in English:
* Curriculum Vitae (including your contact address, work experience, publications);
* Cover letter indicating your research interests and your motivation;
* Contact information for at least 2 referees.
Applications should be sent to Salvatore Anzalone: sanzalone@univ-paris8.fr

We look forward to receiving your application and learning more about your qualifications and research interests.
